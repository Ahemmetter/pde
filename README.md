PDE tasks for Computational Methods (ITMO 2017)


These scripts use matplotlib to simulate the behaviour of the three fundamental types of partial differential equations (PDEs): elliptic (Laplace equation), parabolic (heat equation) and hyperbolic (wave equation).

## Laplace equation

The Laplace equation is solved by an iterative solver and a inverse matrix method solver.

## Heat equation

The heat equation is implemented in several different methods: Backward solver, Forward solver, Crank-Nicolson solver and a solver that allows any value of Theta to be set (any mixture of Backward and Forward solver).

## Wave equation

The wave equation is solved by an explicit method with specified initial conditions.
